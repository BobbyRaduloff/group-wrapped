[8.08.24, 16:36:05] Boris Radulov: https://keap.com/
[8.08.24, 16:36:05] Boris Radulov: maybe
[8.08.24, 16:36:15] Boris Radulov: if we keep increasing the volume of meetings and its not one time sales
[8.08.24, 16:36:21] Boris Radulov: might be worth it to keep track of wagwan
[8.08.24, 17:43:12] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah that’s a good idea
[8.08.24, 17:43:37] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I think Hubspot and Zoho may be options too
[8.08.24, 23:25:41] Robert Tan: Ahhhh
[8.08.24, 23:25:46] Robert Tan: That’s a rlly good idea actually
‎[9.08.24, 11:18:05] Robert Tan: ‎image omitted
[9.08.24, 11:30:57] Boris Radulov: Bougie
[9.08.24, 11:35:50] Robert Tan: I just ate sea urchin
[9.08.24, 11:35:51] Robert Tan: 💀
[9.08.24, 11:35:55] Robert Tan: That shit was not fire
[9.08.24, 19:41:20] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Just had a meeting
[9.08.24, 19:41:27] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Pretty much our perfect client
[9.08.24, 19:41:39] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Unlimited leads for who he wants to target
[9.08.24, 19:41:51] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Unfortunately did not close on the call
[9.08.24, 19:42:05] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But got him booked in for the 30th to see where he’s at
[9.08.24, 19:42:23] Arkadiy Alekseyev: He’s weighing out all of his options
[9.08.24, 19:42:51] Arkadiy Alekseyev: My rizz is not good enough to make him close on the call
[9.08.24, 19:43:12] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But I managed to squeeze out the name of another company he spoke to recently
[9.08.24, 19:43:16] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Leadsend
[9.08.24, 19:43:32] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Their price is a bit worse than ours
[9.08.24, 19:44:10] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But their minimum is $499
[9.08.24, 19:44:23] Arkadiy Alekseyev: For like 11k a month?
[9.08.24, 20:21:54] Boris Radulov: They have a good offer on their website
[9.08.24, 20:21:55] Boris Radulov: Ngl
‎[9.08.24, 20:22:04] Boris Radulov: ‎image omitted
[9.08.24, 21:46:25] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Second meeting went very well
[9.08.24, 21:46:29] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Not a close again
[9.08.24, 21:46:44] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But this guy has worked with similar companies to us who have been shit
[9.08.24, 21:46:50] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But he really liked me
[9.08.24, 21:47:06] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I didn’t give him any guarantees and that’s what he said is usually a red flag
[9.08.24, 21:47:19] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But yeah rizzed him up pretty hard
[9.08.24, 21:47:42] Arkadiy Alekseyev: He booked with us again for like 22nd
[9.08.24, 21:48:20] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Basicslly needs his CEO to approve of this cos he’s very untrusting of these kinds of services as they’ve had a terrible experience
[9.08.24, 21:48:32] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But those other ones were like charging 5k setup costs
[9.08.24, 21:48:38] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And one of them was 5k a month
[9.08.24, 21:48:46] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And got them dog shit meetings
[9.08.24, 21:48:56] Arkadiy Alekseyev: The other one got them like zero meetings
[9.08.24, 21:49:06] Arkadiy Alekseyev: So I think we’ve got our work cut out with this one
[10.08.24, 1:59:28] Robert Tan: Hrmmm this is all interesting
[10.08.24, 1:59:39] Robert Tan: Let’s chat tn for me (morning for u guys)
[10.08.24, 2:01:09] Robert Tan: The main thing we gotta think about is building trust - I don’t think it’s a service problem that not closing but they seem to be sceptical because of past experiences etc
[10.08.24, 2:01:25] Robert Tan: At the end of the day 999 usd with no service fee for a business is not a big investment
[10.08.24, 2:01:37] Robert Tan: So if we can find a way to make them relax and trust us we’ll begin closing
[10.08.24, 11:29:02] Boris Radulov: Sounds good
[10.08.24, 11:29:10] Boris Radulov: I can call in an hour/hour and a half
[10.08.24, 12:01:14] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah  can we stick to 11:00 London time?
[10.08.24, 12:01:34] Boris Radulov: Okay sounds good
[10.08.24, 12:01:57] Boris Radulov: Didn’t know there was an agreed exact hour
[10.08.24, 12:02:29] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Lol Albert said to me by text yesterday that he wanted to do around 11:00
[10.08.24, 12:02:46] Boris Radulov: 🕴🏿
[10.08.24, 12:39:15] Robert Tan: Uhhhh

[10.08.24, 12:39:46] Robert Tan: And don’t have data - just at a service station currently and on wifi
[10.08.24, 12:40:37] Robert Tan: I can do in around 2 hours?

[11.08.24, 11:14:19] Robert Tan: I think overall this would be better for servicing clients (25,000 x 0.001 = 25 dollars) so client sending costs would only be 25 dollars - but for us it’s better with instantly for now since 99 per month we can sort of send unlimited by removing data and reuploading etc
[11.08.24, 11:14:23] Robert Tan: What u guys think
[11.08.24, 15:00:05] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yes exactly
[11.08.24, 15:00:27] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Cos our limit on instantly is meant to be 125,000 emails per month
[11.08.24, 15:01:32] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Idk if it’s actually a set limit or how it works but either way for us it’ll be cheaper with instantly
[11.08.24, 15:37:57] Boris Radulov: The point is not cost savings
[11.08.24, 15:38:13] Boris Radulov: If we want to do long game on this business
[11.08.24, 15:38:25] Boris Radulov: And we want it to be fully automated and/or self service at some point
[11.08.24, 15:38:28] Boris Radulov: We need Amazon SES
[11.08.24, 15:38:46] Boris Radulov: But Amazon SES starts you off at 200 emails per day limit
[11.08.24, 15:39:15] Boris Radulov: And it can only go up as you send and you keep a high reputation
[11.08.24, 15:39:25] Boris Radulov: So we need to start slowing working a reputation with Amazon
[11.08.24, 15:39:37] Boris Radulov: And this software is like instantly but through Amazon SES
[11.08.24, 15:39:53] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I’ve heard very bad things about Amazon SES
[11.08.24, 15:39:59] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Do you have time to call Boris?
[11.08.24, 15:42:47] Boris Radulov: No I’m installing appliances rn in the new apartment ‎<This message was edited>

[12.08.24, 10:54:57] Robert Tan: They just keep asking more questions

[12.08.24, 16:31:58] Robert Tan: I’ll look into it
[12.08.24, 16:32:10] Robert Tan: But yeah as it stands I dont think we’re vat registered
[12.08.24, 16:32:18] Robert Tan: I’ll have a word with my accountant anyways
[12.08.24, 16:32:20] Boris Radulov: ok ty
[12.08.24, 16:32:23] Robert Tan: :)

[12.08.24, 22:54:26] Boris Radulov: Guys does this make sense?
[12.08.24, 22:54:40] Boris Radulov: 25k + one follow up is almost same price as 50k
[12.08.24, 22:54:51] Boris Radulov: And then for the other ones it’s the same or much
[12.08.24, 22:55:39] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yes makes complete sense
[12.08.24, 22:55:43] Arkadiy Alekseyev: That’s how it should be
[12.08.24, 22:56:26] Boris Radulov: So how does the whole thing about
[12.08.24, 22:56:35] Boris Radulov: Follow ups are cheaper since we don’t source data
[12.08.24, 22:56:40] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Because 25k + 1 follow up is just sending two emails to almost 25l ppl
[12.08.24, 22:56:58] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yes but we still need to buy emails and domains
[12.08.24, 22:57:01] Boris Radulov: Make sense if you can send 50k to  50k for the same price
[12.08.24, 22:57:01] Arkadiy Alekseyev: That’s the main cost
[12.08.24, 22:57:15] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Wdym
‎[12.08.24, 22:58:05] Boris Radulov: ‎audio omitted
‎[12.08.24, 22:59:21] Arkadiy Alekseyev: ‎audio omitted
[12.08.24, 22:59:28] Boris Radulov: Like it’s obvs not the exact same price but for the higher ones it is
‎[12.08.24, 22:59:47] Arkadiy Alekseyev: ‎audio omitted
[12.08.24, 23:00:07] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Maybe we can up the 100k one by 100
[12.08.24, 23:00:14] Boris Radulov: Is that what we’re supposed to be saying
‎[12.08.24, 23:00:20] Arkadiy Alekseyev: ‎audio omitted
[12.08.24, 23:00:23] Boris Radulov: I keep saying it’s the data cost
[12.08.24, 23:00:23] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Well
[12.08.24, 23:00:47] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Like theres no set thing were meant to say
[12.08.24, 23:00:50] Boris Radulov: We’ll whatever I don’t think it has been an issue for me
[12.08.24, 23:01:09] Boris Radulov: I was just a bit confused
[12.08.24, 23:01:09] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But like if we want ppl to still pay 1k for contacting less people
[12.08.24, 23:01:31] Boris Radulov: But if we’re saying (which is true) that the main cost is sending capacity it makes sense
[12.08.24, 23:01:38] Arkadiy Alekseyev: No i get the point like the 50% extra was just something I pulled out my ass
[12.08.24, 23:01:52] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I think realistically it does
[12.08.24, 23:02:16] Boris Radulov: Although we do say that there is a fixed to scraper and that’s why we can’t give 1k data sample for example
[12.08.24, 23:02:22] Boris Radulov: So it makes sense that like
[12.08.24, 23:02:30] Arkadiy Alekseyev: 25k on export Apollo costs 98
[12.08.24, 23:02:48] Boris Radulov: X + follow up is 100usd cheaper than 2x
[12.08.24, 23:02:53] Arkadiy Alekseyev: 4 domains 20 emails costs idk how much
[12.08.24, 23:03:19] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah that makes sense
[12.08.24, 23:03:52] Arkadiy Alekseyev: 50k costs 158
‎[12.08.24, 23:04:00] Boris Radulov: ‎image omitted
[12.08.24, 23:04:16] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah that’s what I was thinking
[12.08.24, 23:04:30] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Also this cunt hasn’t shown up but he confirmed the meeting
[12.08.24, 23:04:37] Boris Radulov: @447858360465 thoughts? ‎<This message was edited>
[12.08.24, 23:04:47] Boris Radulov: Wtf
[12.08.24, 23:04:47] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Ahahhaha
[12.08.24, 23:05:02] Boris Radulov: Shhh got confused there
[12.08.24, 23:05:02] Arkadiy Alekseyev: How did you type wtf and not thoughts?
[12.08.24, 23:05:18] Boris Radulov: Cus I was trying to reply to two messages at the same time
[12.08.24, 23:05:22] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Ahahhaha
[12.08.24, 23:05:24] Boris Radulov: Wanted to ask Albert but also wtf on the no show
[12.08.24, 23:05:26] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Fair
[12.08.24, 23:05:34] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah no show be cringe
[12.08.24, 23:05:46] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Makes no sense if you reconfirm as well
[13.08.24, 2:53:10] Robert Tan: Sup guys
[13.08.24, 2:53:13] Robert Tan: Yes I agree
[13.08.24, 2:53:23] Robert Tan: The follow up should look cheaper than the next package
[13.08.24, 2:53:34] Robert Tan: Otherwise what’s the point of buying the follow up
[13.08.24, 2:53:45] Robert Tan: We should slightly increase the 50k package price and the 100k package price
[13.08.24, 2:53:49] Robert Tan: So the diff looks better
[13.08.24, 2:54:20] Robert Tan: But we don’t need to go crazy over it
[13.08.24, 2:54:32] Robert Tan: The clients won’t really see the numbers next to eachother like this
[13.08.24, 12:41:28] Robert Tan: Hola mi amors - I can’t really speak now but I wanted to check you’re all ok? 👌
[13.08.24, 13:23:42] Boris Radulov: It’s good yeah
[13.08.24, 13:23:46] Boris Radulov: Only two meetings today
[13.08.24, 16:29:03] Boris Radulov: Anything back from the Indians about dkim?
[13.08.24, 16:34:22] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Ah yes hold on
[13.08.24, 16:34:37] Arkadiy Alekseyev: hi do not have edit access - added dkim here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U7We5h6G-aiAocr5A9KPWDxp2_ULfJVeIu2j1_Qgx8o/edit?gid=1224235778#gid=1224235778

[14.08.24, 17:27:32] Robert Tan: Don’t see why not
[14.08.24, 17:27:43] Arkadiy Alekseyev: As in what’s the legality of that?
[14.08.24, 17:27:53] Robert Tan: Just ask them the source of this list
[14.08.24, 17:28:00] Robert Tan: Ie is it opted in
[14.08.24, 17:28:04] Robert Tan: That’s all we care about
[14.08.24, 17:28:07] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah that’s what I was thinking
[14.08.24, 17:28:10] Robert Tan: Tbh it won’t impact us tho
[14.08.24, 17:28:12] Robert Tan: It doesn’t matter
[14.08.24, 17:28:17] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I guess
[14.08.24, 17:28:22] Robert Tan: It’s their business name on the line not ours
[14.08.24, 17:28:28] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah
[14.08.24, 17:28:29] Robert Tan: Their domains and their leads
[14.08.24, 17:28:32] Robert Tan: So just say sure
[14.08.24, 17:28:38] Robert Tan: I’ll let u decide the pricing for that
[14.08.24, 17:28:50] Arkadiy Alekseyev: We can just do standard pricing d
[14.08.24, 17:28:55] Robert Tan: Sure
[14.08.24, 17:28:58] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Depending if they want sequencing and what not
[14.08.24, 17:29:11] Robert Tan: Just mby cut off 100 dollars cuz of data or whatever
[14.08.24, 17:29:23] Robert Tan: Since prices are live on website
[14.08.24, 17:29:41] Robert Tan: Ig u don’t even have to tbh
[14.08.24, 17:29:46] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah I mean if they’re not happy with the price
[14.08.24, 17:29:48] Robert Tan: Our service is email sending after all
[14.08.24, 17:29:53] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But like same thing yeah exactly
[14.08.24, 17:29:57] Robert Tan: Ye
[14.08.24, 17:30:12] Robert Tan: Ok bro I’m gonna sleep now but looks good
[14.08.24, 17:30:21] Robert Tan: Back in 2 days 🙌🙌
[14.08.24, 17:33:20] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Alright bro sleep well
‎[14.08.24, 17:33:45] Robert Tan: ‎GIF omitted
[14.08.24, 18:55:16] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Just had another meeting. Not closed, I think perhaps he is not the exclusive decision maker. But overall he seemed very interested. He did express his hesitations to me and I handled them pretty well so I dont think there was much else I could have done to close him.
[14.08.24, 18:55:27] Arkadiy Alekseyev: There are more notes on this on Notion
[14.08.24, 20:40:18] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Alas second meeting was a waste of time
[14.08.24, 20:40:38] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Guy wanted to just learn about our service but had zero intention of working with us
[14.08.24, 20:40:49] Boris Radulov: Bruh moment
[14.08.24, 20:40:54] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Super niche company tho
[14.08.24, 20:41:10] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Like an app or system for helping home builders schedule their time better
[14.08.24, 20:41:22] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And like book people to help them build specific things
[14.08.24, 20:41:32] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Some old dude from a southern state
[14.08.24, 20:41:38] Arkadiy Alekseyev: He was pretty polite tho
[14.08.24, 20:41:40] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Oh well
[15.08.24, 2:21:38] Robert Tan: I think we need to change targeting and make the calendly filters a bit harsher
[15.08.24, 2:22:01] Robert Tan: From what I hear these guys aren’t coming in with the intent to buy even if it’s in the back of their minds
[15.08.24, 2:22:08] Robert Tan: Which makes the meetings relatively fruitless
[15.08.24, 2:22:47] Robert Tan: We need them to come in with some form of actionable intent
[15.08.24, 19:26:58] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Btw I found out how we can also recycle data very effectively
[15.08.24, 19:27:10] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And just manage campaign data overall
[15.08.24, 19:27:26] Arkadiy Alekseyev: As Albert knows you can just delete leads that bounced
[15.08.24, 19:27:37] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But you can also download leads that didn’t reply
[15.08.24, 19:27:44] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Or download all the leads
[15.08.24, 19:28:03] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And the csv contains all the info of whether they’re interested or not
[15.08.24, 19:28:11] Arkadiy Alekseyev: So we can add ppl to a DNC list
[15.08.24, 19:28:28] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But 90% of the data is completely reusable cos we got no reply
‎[16.08.24, 20:04:13] Arkadiy Alekseyev: ‎image omitted
[16.08.24, 20:52:55] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Just had a meeting with some woman that booked through our website replied with an out of office email
[16.08.24, 20:53:34] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Which is interesting but she’s considering other services rn and she’s more interested in a pay per lead/meeting service
[16.08.24, 20:54:07] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Like she had one company do it all for free (except set up cost I think) but asked for a commission
[16.08.24, 20:54:41] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Their customer lifetime value however is 250k
[17.08.24, 22:11:25] Boris Radulov: idk
[17.08.24, 22:11:40] Boris Radulov: i think we shouldnt stray away too much
[17.08.24, 22:12:00] Boris Radulov: and like we cant be certain we can get results for these guys
[17.08.24, 22:27:52] Robert Tan: Hey Boris
[17.08.24, 22:27:55] Robert Tan: I have returned

[30.08.24, 21:49:08] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But wys
[30.08.24, 21:50:55] Boris Radulov: I know it is
[30.08.24, 21:51:00] Boris Radulov: I know our service is cheap
[30.08.24, 21:51:05] Boris Radulov: I was just left with the impression
[30.08.24, 21:51:10] Boris Radulov: That even for just the sending we’re cheaper
[30.08.24, 21:51:23] Boris Radulov: How exactly?
[30.08.24, 21:51:35] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Cos they do onboarding
[30.08.24, 21:51:47] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And just a bit more 1-1
[30.08.24, 21:52:00] Boris Radulov: Interesting
[30.08.24, 21:52:08] Boris Radulov: So on premium it’s not entirely self service
[30.08.24, 21:52:27] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I think for the most part but they do help you more I think
[30.08.24, 21:52:33] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I’m not too sure tbh
[30.08.24, 21:52:44] Arkadiy Alekseyev: This is from just reading the plan comparison
[30.08.24, 21:52:54] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But their premium is still cheaper
[30.08.24, 21:53:01] Arkadiy Alekseyev: And they include follow ups for free
[30.08.24, 21:53:05] Arkadiy Alekseyev: As far as I’m aware
[30.08.24, 21:53:22] Boris Radulov: I mean we’ve never had an objection of someone saying
[30.08.24, 21:53:28] Boris Radulov: I could do this myself on Mailchimp
[30.08.24, 21:53:36] Boris Radulov: So probably not an issue so far
[30.08.24, 21:53:43] Boris Radulov: Was just caught very off guard by it
[30.08.24, 21:54:56] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah I was literally thinking this that we could refer ppl to mail chimp and give them so many customers lol
[30.08.24, 21:55:12] Boris Radulov: Wait wym
[30.08.24, 21:55:25] Arkadiy Alekseyev: It’s a completely retarded thought
[30.08.24, 21:55:35] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Just if we tell ppl about mail chimp
[30.08.24, 21:55:42] Arkadiy Alekseyev: They would probably try it
[30.08.24, 21:55:43] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Idk
[30.08.24, 21:55:50] Boris Radulov: Why would we do that
[30.08.24, 21:55:52] Boris Radulov: 💀💀💀
[30.08.24, 21:55:53] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yes exactly
[30.08.24, 21:56:09] Boris Radulov: Sometimes arkadiy works in mysterious ways
[30.08.24, 21:56:08] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But like some ppl also don’t want to bother with the self service anyway
[30.08.24, 21:56:18] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Which makes us more appealing in that sense
[30.08.24, 21:56:23] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Trust me
[30.08.24, 21:56:34] Arkadiy Alekseyev: You’ve not seen the worst of my schizophrenia yet

[16.09.24, 22:58:30] Boris Radulov: it kills the illusion

[17.09.24, 11:54:15] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Deine Migga
[17.09.24, 18:18:41] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yo
[17.09.24, 18:18:47] Arkadiy Alekseyev: What’s the sitch
[17.09.24, 18:18:56] Boris Radulov: Wym
[17.09.24, 18:19:27] Boris Radulov: Am in another meeting
[17.09.24, 18:19:42] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Calm just call me when ur about
[17.09.24, 21:28:27] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Okay so am making emails for Mark now
[17.09.24, 21:28:30] Arkadiy Alekseyev: It’s a pain
[17.09.24, 21:28:35] Arkadiy Alekseyev: They all need phone number
[17.09.24, 21:28:42] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Using SMSpool
[17.09.24, 21:28:45] Arkadiy Alekseyev: But it’s so slow
[17.09.24, 21:29:05] Arkadiy Alekseyev: This is not reliable
[17.09.24, 21:38:41] Robert Tan: Yeah
[17.09.24, 21:38:47] Robert Tan: When we fill this workspace up
[17.09.24, 21:38:50] Robert Tan: I hope the next one is fine
[17.09.24, 21:42:05] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah maybe if we fill them up faster then it’s less likely they start doing that
[17.09.24, 21:44:17] Robert Tan: Yeah
[18.09.24, 11:02:12] Boris Radulov: feedback:
- outreach email
	- “performance based email lead generation” are 5 buzz words that dont resonate even to me as someone that works in customer acquisitgion. explain it much simpler
	- hone in on the fact that you have access to leads. people who know about emails know about mailchimp, sengrid, etc. boast about your database
	- overall seems like a scam because no concrete information, no link to said business insider article,
	- asking to send a link seems hella sus. ask to send sample leads instead.
	- name of company not included
	- wanted to customize something like “potential by targeting medium sized university laboratories to sell your product”
- intro video
	- explain cold emailing before comparing it with other
	- show example of why script is better literally side by side
	- youre talking so much about shit idk what it is (domains, blacklist, etc.) idk if you should even bother with this
	- remove the capcut 
	- explain actually what this will do for my business like what ur talking about outreach but like not everyone know why they should even ooutreach or like what a fucking ROI is
- emma is not on the team section lol
- actual webpage
	- its not clear enough you source the leads and have a huge database. the targeting section is not good enough. “i dont want mailchimp i want leads”.
	- dashboard looks way too simple, im paying 1k for a graph and three datapoints? replace that screenshot with a screenshot of a campaign with actual results similar to how dropshipping courses show screenshots of shopify sales analytics
[18.09.24, 11:02:19] Boris Radulov: first feedback form my mate in nyc
[18.09.24, 11:02:35] Boris Radulov: not ecveyrthing applies
[18.09.24, 11:02:38] Boris Radulov: but i think its really good
[18.09.24, 11:02:50] Boris Radulov: if anything is unclear ask cus i was typing aas he was speaking
[18.09.24, 11:13:05] Boris Radulov: also asked another guy who owns a business to take a look
[18.09.24, 11:13:14] Boris Radulov: but his feedback wont come in until later today
[18.09.24, 11:33:03] Boris Radulov: also guys
[18.09.24, 11:33:06] Boris Radulov: VERY IMPORTANT imo
[18.09.24, 11:33:13] Boris Radulov: we need to look at all our clients today
[18.09.24, 11:33:20] Boris Radulov: and see who is approaching a rebill
[18.09.24, 11:33:24] Boris Radulov: and maybe extend for a bit
[18.09.24, 13:04:17] Robert Tan: Yeah agreed
[18.09.24, 13:04:24] Robert Tan: I’ll hop on in an hour or so
[18.09.24, 13:04:30] Robert Tan: And let’s sort all of this out
[18.09.24, 13:22:25] Boris Radulov: I want to wait for some more feedback to accumulate until end of day
[18.09.24, 13:22:32] Boris Radulov: So we don’t bias too much
[18.09.24, 13:22:33] Boris Radulov: Idk
[18.09.24, 13:23:48] Robert Tan: Ok
[18.09.24, 13:23:57] Robert Tan: I’ll start thinking of script changes in the meantime then
[18.09.24, 13:24:01] Robert Tan: Until we collect more info
[18.09.24, 13:24:04] Robert Tan: I will ask around as well

[25.09.24, 13:25:00] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I also just realised that making the 50k minimum thing is so good cos it means they’re much more likely to get 5 interested replies
[25.09.24, 13:25:04] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Within a week
[25.09.24, 13:25:10] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Esp with 100k package

[25.09.24, 13:39:40] Arkadiy Alekseyev: I’m just worried about if payment doesn’t go through when we charge them

[25.09.24, 13:53:09] Robert Tan: Guys this guy

[25.09.24, 13:53:21] Robert Tan: I can 100% close him but wanna speak about it first
[25.09.24, 13:53:26] Robert Tan: I will put him on the back burner for now
[25.09.24, 13:53:37] Robert Tan: I will close the others tho game over
[26.09.24, 11:18:59] Boris Radulov: im lowering wizmo emails to 45 per day

[1.10.24, 16:09:04] Robert Tan: Bit stressed as google emails are fucking up
[1.10.24, 16:09:16] Robert Tan: But we are trying a different provider

[1.10.24, 16:09:28] Alex Radulov: ah based, hope it works
[1.10.24, 16:09:32] Robert Tan: :)
[1.10.24, 16:09:43] Robert Tan: U got time this week to hop on?
[1.10.24, 16:10:03] Alex Radulov: yeah absolutely
[1.10.24, 16:10:22] Robert Tan: Cool I’ll text you later - just trying to figure this email stuff out today but maybe tomorrow let’s hop on?
[1.10.24, 16:10:24] Robert Tan: :)
[1.10.24, 16:10:52] Alex Radulov: yeah just let me know when you are free
[1.10.24, 23:41:57] Boris Radulov: quick thought before i go to bed
[1.10.24, 23:42:07] Boris Radulov: something maybe we’ve failed to consider re: client success
[1.10.24, 23:42:16] Boris Radulov: the less specific the offering of the client
[1.10.24, 23:42:22] Boris Radulov: the more sending capacity necessary by definition
[1.10.24, 23:42:29] Boris Radulov: since the less niche the service
[1.10.24, 23:42:32] Boris Radulov: the lower the conversion rate
[1.10.24, 23:43:11] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah but it doesn’t guarantee results even if the niche is more narrow
[1.10.24, 23:43:21] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Like lees campaign was super niche but results were ass
[1.10.24, 23:43:50] Boris Radulov: ex with wizmo being: sending emails about selling just normal shampoo to people that have hair (cloud services to just business owners) will get much worse results than sending emails about anti hairloss shampoo to people who you know are balding
[1.10.24, 23:43:55] Boris Radulov: to continue with analogy tho
[1.10.24, 23:43:57] Boris Radulov: i think lee was
[1.10.24, 23:44:15] Boris Radulov: selling anti hairloss shampoo specifically for people with ginger hair aged 35-47 exclusively
[1.10.24, 23:44:20] Boris Radulov: like his shit was too niche
[1.10.24, 23:44:30] Boris Radulov: i think its kind of like a parabola curve
[1.10.24, 23:44:36] Boris Radulov: and there’s a sweet spot somewhere in the middle
[1.10.24, 23:45:19] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah this is something similar to what I was thinking about our ICP or even ppl who we can service
[1.10.24, 23:45:48] Boris Radulov: obvs we cant send much more than people are paying for if we determine their niche is too broad ‎<This message was edited>
[1.10.24, 23:45:51] Boris Radulov: but for wizmo for example
[1.10.24, 23:45:58] Boris Radulov: (besides obvs pushing them for bigger plan)
[1.10.24, 23:46:04] Boris Radulov: we could’ve spoken to them about
[1.10.24, 23:46:13] Boris Radulov: specific niches and industries they have had good success with
[1.10.24, 23:46:20] Boris Radulov: and framed it for example
[1.10.24, 23:46:26] Boris Radulov: “cloud services for medical institutions"
[1.10.24, 23:46:28] Boris Radulov: type shit

[1.10.24, 23:51:07] Boris Radulov: verifier + mailcheap definitely seems to have made a difference

[6.10.24, 22:01:59] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Okay they’re all set up
[6.10.24, 22:02:20] Arkadiy Alekseyev: They have warmup emails already apparently idk why they weren’t all connected
[6.10.24, 22:02:26] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Did we use them for mailcheapv
[6.10.24, 22:02:29] Arkadiy Alekseyev: ?
[6.10.24, 22:24:35] Robert Tan: No clue tbh
[6.10.24, 22:24:56] Boris Radulov: Yeah we had them on mailcheap
[6.10.24, 22:24:59] Boris Radulov: But only warmup
[6.10.24, 22:58:36] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Hmm well I’ve logged them in through google using panjeet
[6.10.24, 22:58:40] Arkadiy Alekseyev: So hopefully they’re fine
[6.10.24, 22:59:05] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Idk if they’re fully warm enough to work amazingly but hopefully the Bulgarian servers don’t flag them
[6.10.24, 22:59:47] Boris Radulov: I think it’s gonna be fine
[6.10.24, 23:40:37] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Slightly concerning thing as well: out of just under 5k leads, verified we only got under 1.5k for 3 bulba lead lists so far
[6.10.24, 23:44:18] Robert Tan: Hrmmm
[6.10.24, 23:44:24] Robert Tan: Mby there are a lot of bad leads there
[6.10.24, 23:44:31] Robert Tan: Either way there should be enough there to test
[6.10.24, 23:44:35] Robert Tan: If we need to pull more we pull mire
[6.10.24, 23:44:44] Robert Tan: If we need to test more we can try other datasets too
[6.10.24, 23:45:06] Robert Tan: I think background project in a week or so should be slightly improving verifier
[6.10.24, 23:45:07] Arkadiy Alekseyev: Yeah I mean I think maybe was some entry leads who have left the company since
[6.10.24, 23:45:10] Robert Tan: So we can get more out of it tho
[6.10.24, 23:45:23] Robert Tan: But first let’s try get results for clients :)
[6.10.24, 23:46:11] Arkadiy Alekseyev: For me personally, reliable source of data + ability to put multiple campaigns onto dashboard would be best
[6.10.24, 23:46:23] Robert Tan: Arkadiy
[6.10.24, 23:46:27] Robert Tan: Can you call for 2 min or r u busy

[27.10.24, 3:35:26] Robert Tan: Is this potentially for sending?
[27.10.24, 3:35:29] Robert Tan: Or for verifier
[27.10.24, 3:35:36] Boris Radulov: He’ll get back to me on Monday
[27.10.24, 3:35:44] Boris Radulov: But we should be able to get our own IP range
[27.10.24, 3:35:56] Boris Radulov: Meaning we’d be fully responsible but also no risk of someone else fucking it up for us

[27.10.24, 3:36:42] Robert Tan: My final recommendation to you
[27.10.24, 3:36:46] Boris Radulov: I say we test with verifier first
[27.10.24, 3:36:49] Robert Tan: Agreed
[27.10.24, 3:36:58] Boris Radulov: Only issue rn is to see if we can get them on a short term contract
[27.10.24, 3:37:04] Boris Radulov: I don’t wanna lock ina year yet

[29.10.24, 20:31:13] Alex Radulov: ?
[31.10.24, 12:31:52] Boris Radulov: i texted albert but tldr for people here
[31.10.24, 12:32:08] Boris Radulov: after 4 grueling days trying shit with verifier
[31.10.24, 12:32:18] Boris Radulov: best results i can get is 75% cut rate
[31.10.24, 12:32:24] Boris Radulov: thats with removing catch all
[31.10.24, 12:32:38] Boris Radulov: if we are okay with catchall
[31.10.24, 12:32:43] Boris Radulov: we can do about 50% cut rate
[31.10.24, 12:32:44] Boris Radulov: however
‎[31.10.24, 12:32:53] Boris Radulov: ‎image omitted
[31.10.24, 12:33:13] Boris Radulov: the issue is this ~30% auth chunk of emails
[31.10.24, 12:33:19] Boris Radulov: those are almost exclusively outlook
‎[31.10.24, 12:33:31] Boris Radulov: ‎image omitted
[31.10.24, 12:33:44] Boris Radulov: and the only way around this is actually authenticating to outlook servers
[31.10.24, 12:33:52] Boris Radulov: and this means outlook grandfather accounts
[31.10.24, 12:34:08] Boris Radulov: which i dont need to explain why its really bad
[31.10.24, 12:34:33] Boris Radulov: we can maybe authenticate 100 a day
[31.10.24, 12:34:53] Boris Radulov: per account
[31.10.24, 12:34:57] Boris Radulov: if the limits are the same like sending
[31.10.24, 12:35:26] Boris Radulov: there’s a hard limit of 5K per account
[31.10.24, 12:35:40] Boris Radulov: but i dont know how close we can get to that before we start getting our grandfather accounts banned
[31.10.24, 12:36:06] Boris Radulov: since most sources quote verification and sending to be essentially the same in terms of violations of ToS, spam consideration, etc.
[31.10.24, 12:36:45] Boris Radulov: so basically verifier scaling is at the same shit as sending scaling
[31.10.24, 12:36:50] Boris Radulov: but with outlook grandfather accounts
[31.10.24, 12:36:51] Boris Radulov: gg
[31.10.24, 12:39:19] Boris Radulov: my only hope now is to see if i can trick them
[31.10.24, 12:39:26] Boris Radulov: i.e. spf, dkim, dmarc etc
[31.10.24, 12:39:40] Boris Radulov: so that they see us as trustworthy as possible and dont ask for auth
[31.10.24, 12:39:44] Boris Radulov: but thats a long shot

[31.10.24, 14:41:24] Boris Radulov: 75%
