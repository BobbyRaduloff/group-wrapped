4/2/25, 5:28 PM - Amelia created group "Legal project"
4/2/25, 5:28 PM - Amelia added you
4/2/25, 5:30 PM - Amelia: Hii, thought I’d create a group for the legal project from now so we can discuss which side we want to take (deadline is the 4th). I’ll create a poll, if someone hasn’t had the chance to decide which side they’d prefer, pls do so until tmrw so we can make a choice and write it in the file!
4/2/25, 5:33 PM - Amelia: POLL:
which side we’ll represent
OPTION: A (owner) (4 votes)
OPTION: B (management) (0 votes)

4/3/25, 6:58 PM - Amelia: Okay pretty unanimous we’ll be representing A hahah, i’ll write that down in the file, could everyone please write their full name since i don’t have them all🙏

4/3/25, 7:48 PM - +39 344 565 5408: Galiana Chavdarova Kasnedelcheva
4/3/25, 7:52 PM - Alexander Radulov: Aleksanar Radulov
4/4/25, 6:26 PM - Amelia: btw should we try to ask if another guy wants to join? we’re 5 which is recommended but a bit unbalanced gender-wise
4/4/25, 6:30 PM - +39 344 565 5408: Yeah, that would be great
4/24/25, 5:28 PM - Amelia: Hi everyone, i thinks we should start on the project so we’re done in about a week to avoid any last minute stress. I think it would be best to create a memorandum to present our points but lmk if you all agree/have other ideas so we can designate which parts we’ll all work on!
4/25/25, 11:20 AM - +7 985 026-02-62: Yes, sure!
4/27/25, 1:19 PM - Amelia: ive drafted the beginning of the document until the legal issues part so we can divide those for legal analysis. i think its best to have 3, maybe 4, depending on how we want to allocate the work. (the way ive phrased the questions is just a draft to see what i think would be our strongest points to make) <This message was edited>

4/27/25, 1:20 PM - Amelia: apparently we should use the IRAC framework to develop each issue
4/27/25, 1:22 PM - Amelia: <Media omitted>
4/27/25, 2:23 PM - +7 985 026-02-62: Yes, I think we can take one point each and analyse it with IRAC
I can take the first one🦦
4/27/25, 2:27 PM - +39 344 565 5408: I will take the second one
4/27/25, 2:32 PM - Alexander Radulov: I can take the third one
4/27/25, 3:27 PM - Amelia: alright, Maria, if you could take the last one and i’ll finish the rest of the memorandum apart from the analysis and i’ll make it all in the same style when we have all the parts <This message was edited>

4/30/25, 5:31 PM - Amelia: hii just wanted to ask how everyone’s part is going, if anyone needs help for the analysis lmk so we can finish in the next couple days :)
4/30/25, 5:47 PM - +7 985 026-02-62: Heeey
4/30/25, 5:49 PM - +7 985 026-02-62: Gimme 30 minutes, I’ll send it 
I tried to expand it as much as I could, coz my part really depends on the second issue 
So I wrote it with a goal to align it with Galiana’s one

5/1/25, 2:58 PM - Amelia: btw i know the first two issues sound similar but my idea was we develop the first based on the wording of the contact and the second based on italian law for when obligations are extinguished if that helps :)
