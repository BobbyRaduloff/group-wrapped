[15/07/2024, 12:48:05] Paul: Peano’s Axioms

Peano’s axioms define the natural numbers \mathbb{N} and include the following:

	1.	0 is a natural number.
	2.	Every natural number n has a unique successor S(n), which is also a natural number.
	3.	0 is not the successor of any natural number.
	4.	Different numbers have different successors: if S(a) = S(b), then a = b.
	5.	Any property that holds for 0 and holds for S(n) whenever it holds for n holds for all natural numbers (Principle of Mathematical Induction).

Defining Addition and Multiplication

Using Peano’s axioms, we define addition (+) and multiplication (\times) as follows:

	1.	n + 0 = n for any natural number n.
	2.	n + S(m) = S(n + m) for any natural numbers n and m.
	3.	n \times 0 = 0 for any natural number n.
	4.	n \times S(m) = (n \times m) + n for any natural numbers n and m.

Proof that 2 \times 2 = 4

First, we need to represent 2 and 4 in terms of Peano’s axioms:

	•	2 is the successor of 1, which is the successor of 0: 2 = S(S(0)).
	•	4 is the successor of 3, which is the successor of 2, which is the successor of 1, which is the successor of 0: 4 = S(S(S(S(0)))).

Now, let’s use the definitions of addition and multiplication:

	1.	Start with 2 \times 2:

2 \times 2 = S(S(0)) \times S(S(0))

	2.	Apply the definition of multiplication:

S(S(0)) \times S(S(0)) = (S(S(0)) \times S(0)) + S(S(0))

	3.	Next, compute S(S(0)) \times S(0):

S(S(0)) \times S(0) = (S(S(0)) \times 0) + S(S(0))

	4.	Using n \times 0 = 0:

S(S(0)) \times 0 = 0

Thus:

S(S(0)) \times S(0) = 0 + S(S(0)) = S(S(0))

	5.	Now substitute back:

S(S(0)) \times S(S(0)) = S(S(0)) + S(S(0))

	6.	Compute S(S(0)) + S(S(0)) using the definition of addition:

S(S(0)) + S(S(0)) = S(S(0) + S(0))

	7.	Apply the definition of addition again:

S(0) + S(0) = S(S(0) + 0) = S(S(0))

Thus:

S(S(0) + S(0)) = S(S(S(0)))

	8.	Finally:

S(S(S(0))) + S(S(0)) = S(S(S(S(0))))


Hence:

2 \times 2 = S(S(S(S(0)))) = 4


This concludes the proof that 2 \times 2 = 4 using Peano’s axioms and the definitions of addition and multiplication.

[23/04/2025, 13:54:01] Paul: Il est très probable que mon petit frère ait en partie des origines franques ou normandes, étant donné nos liens familiaux anciens avec la France. Ces racines pourraient remonter à l’époque médiévale, quand les Francs et les Normands ont laissé une forte empreinte dans l’histoire et la généalogie européennes.

[28/04/2025, 01:23:06] Albert Brotherton: Or like
[28/04/2025, 01:23:08] Albert Brotherton: Swords maybe
[28/04/2025, 01:23:40] Paul: If we had crowbars
[28/04/2025, 01:23:46] Paul: Were perfectly coordinated
[28/04/2025, 01:23:53] Paul: And hit its head quickly
[28/04/2025, 01:23:55] Paul: Then maybe
[28/04/2025, 01:24:02] Paul: Unlikely though
[28/04/2025, 01:24:17] Paul: Swords more likely
[28/04/2025, 01:24:38] Paul: We cripple its mobility slicing its legs first
